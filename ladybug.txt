Once upon a time, in a lush, sunlit meadow, there lived a small, bright red ladybug named Luna. 
Luna was known for her shiny black spots and cheerful demeanor. 
But one day, Luna woke up feeling different. 
Her tiny stomach growled, and she realized she was terribly hungry.

She stretched her delicate wings and set out in search of food. 
Normally, Luna loved munching on aphids, the little green bugs that lived on the stems of tall flowers. 
But today, as she flew from leaf to leaf, she couldn't find a single aphid in sight. 
Luna's tummy rumbled louder, and she began to feel worried.

Determined not to give up, Luna fluttered to the edge of the meadow, where she found a towering oak tree. 
She hoped that maybe here, among its branches, she'd find something to eat. 
As she explored the oak, Luna spotted a trail of tiny ants marching up the bark, carrying food back to their nest.

"Excuse me, friends," Luna called out, her voice soft but hopeful. "Do you know where I might find something to eat?"

The ants looked at her kindly. "We only carry food for our colony," one of them explained. 
"But just over that hill, you'll find a rose garden. Perhaps you'll find something delicious there."
